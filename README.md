# README Generator
As a developer, I want high-end README files for every application or project I work on. READMEs all contain similar information, so I developed a tool that allows me to generate an automatic README given information I input.

## About this Project
This node application will take in user inputs for a readme file and generate a readme automatically with a table of contents and the user inputs located in the corresponding sections of the file.
